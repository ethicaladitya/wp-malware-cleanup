This script totally relies on WP-CLI https://wp-cli.org/ and re-install WP Core, themes and plugins to the latest versions.

In the end it will also display the website homeurl and siteurl, so you can check if they are changed or not. In case if they are changed you'll need to login to phpMyAdmin and change the HOME, SITEURL in the options table. You could check https://github.com/ethicaladitya/WP-Search-Replace in case the home, siteurl returned are different than your website url.

This works when you have root access to the server.

Before running the script, please make sure you provide valid path of WordPress installation instead of "/var/web/site/public_html/
